# Statistical Use of Online Database (Sentiment Analysis)

This project is part of the course at the University of Bologna, focusing on the Statistical Use of Online Databases.

My project involves sentiment analysis of customer reviews from three different telephone companies. To replicate the analysis:

1. Download all the files.
2. Open the R files: "SentimentFunctions.R" and "utility.R", and execute all the functions defined in these files.
3. Follow the code in the R file "Reviews Compagnie.R". Comments within the code provide guidance on its execution.
4. Remember to set the working directory to the downloaded repository to ensure that all the dictionaries provided are being used

I have also attempted to translate the project into an R markdown format, although this remains unfinished as it was not required for the exam.
