# Utilizzo Statistico di Banche Dati Online (Sentiment Analysis)
 This is the project relative to the Course at University of Bologna, called Statistical Use of Database online.

The project was about a sentiment analysis of Reviews from 3 different telephone companies. 
To replicate the Analysis just download all the files, then open the R files: "SentimentFunctions.R", "utility.R" launching all the functions in those files. 

Then just follow the code of the R file "Reviews Compagnie.R" and it should work. I also tried to translate the project to an R markdown but I still haven't finished (it wasnt necessary for the exam).
